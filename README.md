This is a repo to deploy the tutorials of Flame to our website.

The tutorials are included in the mono-repo and can be browsed via GitHub [here](https://github.com/flame-engine/flame/tree/main/tutorials).

This repo will generate web assets for the Space Shooter tutorial and publish them [here](https://tutorials.flame-engine.org).
